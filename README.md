A repository of Identity Management resources for the Public Sector 

# Background

The Federal government is increasingly making a push towards a Zero Trust Architecture model. While many aspects have led to this shift, both from the public sector and private sector, some key pieces of guidance and publications are undeniable. Among some of the key pieces are the Executive Order on Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity which specific called for the Federal Government to adopt a Zero Trust Architecture. This included leveraging guidance from NIST as well as organizations such as CISA, who subsequently published the Zero Trust Maturity Model. Identity is a key pillar in this model and many view Identity as the new perimiter in the Zero Trust data-centric model of cybersecurity. 

This repository will include resources to help public sector agencies, industry partners and academia advance their knowledge of digital identity management to bolster an organizations cybersecurity and advance towards a Zero Trust Architecture and ultimately more secure outcomes and services for Citizens, Warfighters and the Nation.
